Project Description


Story (Brief) 
The story revolves around five brothers who struggle for their rights in the royal family. Two brothers (cousins) claimed to be first in line to inherit the throne. The struggle culminates in the great battle of Kurukshetra, in which Pandavas are ultimately victorious. The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship, the instance of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right, as well as the converse.  

Story (Detailed)
The story is about the struggle between two groups of cousins in the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kauravas and the Pandavas princes and their successors.
Once there was a great dynasty known as kuru. Shantanu king of the Hastinapur and the Kuru dynasty has two wives, Goddess (River) Ganga and fisherman daughter Satyavati. He has a child with Ganga named Devavrata (later Bhishma) who took the vow of lifelong celibacy. And with Satyavati, he has two sons named Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. Vichitravirya had two wives Ambika and Ambalika but he died without any child. Now as the throne is empty and without any successor, Satyavati asks her first son (with a saint named Parashara) to father children with the widows. Ambika had a son Dhritarashtra who is blind and Ambalika had a son named Pandu who is pale and unhealthy. 
Although Dhritarashtra was the older one, as he was blind Pandu was named the king of Hastinapur. After ruling for several years he retires to the forest with his two wifes Kunti and Madri. In the forest, Kunti is blessed with 3 sons from Gods named Yudhisthira, Bhima and Arjuna. Madri is blessed with twin god named Nakula and Sahadeva. On the other hand, king Dhritarashtra and his wife Gandhari gave birth to 100 children.  The five sons of Pandu are known as Pandavas and 100 sons of Dhritarashtra as Kauravas. 
The oldest among all the brothers is Yudhisthira (Pandav) and the oldest among Kauravas is Duryodhana (Next after Yudushtira). Duryodhana always hated Pandavas as he saw them as an outsider and not among royal families. His hatred increased when he knows the next rightful king is Yudhishtira as he is the oldest. Due to this, there is a lot of struggle between Pandavas and Kauravas for the throne and in the end, the king is decided by a furious battle between the two brother groups known as the Kurukshetra War. In which Pandavas come victorious, killing all the Kauravas and all the other members of their army (only 3 left alive).
